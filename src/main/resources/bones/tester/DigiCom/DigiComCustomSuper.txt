Ethernet uses guided media.;true
A MAC address refers to a Macintosh computer.;false
If ten PCs are connected to the same switch, but the first five are assigned to VLAN 10 and the other five are assigned to VLAN 20, then they have been divided into two different subnets.;true
A 'ping' sends an ICMP Echo request.;true
Compared to IPv4, IPv6 streamlines routing decisions and focuses on scalability.;true
IPv4 streamlines routing decisions more than IPv6.;false
When sending a message through the Network layer, an IP header is always attached.;true
The 'version' field in an IP-header indicates the OS-version.;false
The TTL field in the IP header acts as a safeguard against infinite loops.;true
Routing happens at Layer 3 of the OSI model.;true
Forwarding happens at Layer 2 of the OSI model.;false
Forwarding can happen on Layer 3 or 2 depending on context.;true
An IP address is classless when it uses DHCP notation.;false
Using CIDR allows for less wasteful subnetting.;true
A new PC without an IP address sends out a broadcast message in order to discover any DHCP servers on the local network.;true
A client can DHCPREQUEST an IP not offered by a DHCP server.;true
If a client requests an invalid IP from a DHCP server, it responds with DHCPNAK.;true
Given a packet for the destination IP 192.168.1.130, a router following longest prefix matching would choose 192.168.1.0/24 255.255.255.0 over 192.168.1.128/25 255.255.255.128, as the next-hop.;false
The end-to-end argument suggests that functions like error checking should be done at the end-host, not in the middle of the network (routers, switches).;true

A MAC address is 48 bits long.;true
Two PCs would have the same MAC address if they are made by the same manufacturer.;false
If a host does not know the destinations MAC-address on the LAN, but  knows the IP address, then it broadcasts an ARP request.;true
ARP operates only within a single subnet but switches can act as intermediaries between subnets.;false
