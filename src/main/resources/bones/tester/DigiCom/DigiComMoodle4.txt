The same routing algorithms are applied for intra-As and inter-AS routing.;false
An autonomous system (AS) consists of multiple routers operated by the same network provider.;true
OSPF is a distance vector routing protocol.;false
Using BGP the forwarding tables can contain intra-AS as well as inter-AS destinations.;true
Routing protocols exchange information on the control plane.;true
Dijkstra algorithm requires full knowledge about the nodes, edges, and costs to be applied.;true
In link-state-routing algorithms the information exchange only happens between neighbours.;false
After convergence of a distance vector routing, the nodes do not know the full paths to each of the network nodes.;true
The distance-vector-routing algorithm calculates the shortest path based on full knowledge about the network topology.;false
Using distance-vector-routing, every router broadcasts its distance vector after an update.;true
One of the main reasons NAT (Network Address Translation) was invented is the shortage of IPv4 addresses.;true
The usage of NAT (Network Address Translation) is a violation of the end-to-end principle of the network layer.;true
NAT (Network Address Translation) replaces the destination port and IP of an outgoing packet.;false
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) provides information to configure the link layer of the client.;false
Message exchange of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) mainly uses broadcasts.;true
